# dom
Document Object Model

## Purpose
This is a repository consisting of one JavaScript file that allows the user to manipulate the DOM using vanilla JavaScript.
Suggested use: can be linked to other repositories to easily manipulate DOM if not wanting to use jQuery.

## Installation
Clone the repository and copy logic.js into your own repository. 
Copy the following code (amending the file path if needed) into your index.html document to use: 
`<script src="js/logic.js"></script>`

## Contributions
Document is exclusively maintained by Molly Moran, but I welcome contributions.
